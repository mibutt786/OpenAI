# ⚡ ChatGPT → n8n Integration via MCP Server

A powerful integration that enables **ChatGPT to trigger and control n8n workflows** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
This project bridges conversational AI and automation — allowing you to execute n8n flows directly from ChatGPT prompts and pass parameters as well.

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect **OpenAI’s ChatGPT (via AgentKit or custom MCP)** with **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation platform.  
It lets ChatGPT send structured instructions to your n8n instance — to start workflows, pass parameters, and receive execution results.
